____________________________________________________________________________

All mods must be created with the Groovy programming language for now (unless 
you plan on making a custom jar mod), there are possibilities for having
**native** (native in the sense it is running directly in game, the game
is programmed in Java it is 100% NOT native). However, as Groovy is a 
direct JVM language, rather than a language that is not based on the JVM
it shouldn't be very much slower!

We Currrently Support Ruby 3.1!

Mods are looked for in:

For UNIX like opreating systems

[control h in your home directory]

/home/(yourusername)/.local/islandworld/mods/

Note: It doesn't really matter the name since it's all ruby!

Windows:
