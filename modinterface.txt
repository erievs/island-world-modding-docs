Aliases/Bindings

int - int is an alias for def (this is a dynamically typed language and how Apache implemented it you use def for strings, 
integers and such this is to make it a little easier for the programmed used to ruby and such)

puts - puts is an alias for println, this is for people who are used  to ruby.

Console.WriteLine (may be removed as it is causing some issues for some reason) - it is an alais for println, this is for people who are used to C Sharp


Methods Useful For Modding

SetBlock Method


**world.setBlock(x, y, z, (block))**

Use: Spawns a block somewhere in the world by passing in
x,y,z cordnaites and the block you want.

How To Use

1. Define a block with the block you want 

def myBlock = new blocks.Wood(x, y, z, textureIndex)

2. Pass it in world.setBlock

world.setBlock(x, y, z, myBlock)

3. Speficy the x,y,z you want in the world

world.setBlock(1, 2, 3, myBlock)

You're good!


CreateBlock

**COMING SOON**

block.CreateBlock("","",x,y,z)

Use: Creating a custom block, speficy the texture, the name, the x,y,z 
cornaites of were you want to spawn it. (For now, may be used with
setblock instead of directly ;ater on).
