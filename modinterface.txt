Aliases/Bindings

int - int is an alias for def (this is a dynamically typed language and how Apache implemented it you use def for strings, 
integers and such this is to make it a little easier for the programmed used to ruby and such)

puts - puts is an alias for println, this is for people who are used  to ruby.

Console.WriteLine (maybe removed as it is causing some issues for some reason) - it is an alias for println, this is for people who are used to C Sharp


Modding Methods and Such

spawnBlock()

This method spawns a block which is in game (Think wood, grass, any block in game).

1. You first need to PASS a block.

spawnBlock("Grass", , ,)

[This is a list of blocks as of 1/12/2023 may or may not be updated: Grass, Wood, Leaf, Nexus_Grass, Air (Doesn't do anything), Stone,]

[Note: It must be surrounded by parentheses, this is so it doesn't confuse groovy into thinking it's a method or something!]

2. Second, you need to pass in the coordinates of the block you want to spawn. (X,Y,Z).

spawnBlock("Grass",1 ,2 ,3)


constructBlock()

This method creates a custom block.

1. You need to pass the position and texture index and a name. (You can ignore the texture index as it doesn't affect anything and is just required by how we load assets, so just do 0)

constructBlock("MyCoolBlock", x, y, z, 0,)

2. Pass in your texture (it will by default look in the mod folder, however you can make a folder)

constructBlock("MyCoolBlock", x, y, z , 0, "albert.png" ).

3. Now pass in your texture cords and size.

constructBlock("MyCoolBlock", x, y, z, 0, "albert.png", texture-x, texture-y, texture-size-x, texture-size-y)

[Note: 0,0 is fine if its just one image]
