Hello, this is part 2 of this modding series, now last part we just printed some text to the console, this part will teach you how to spawn in a block!

So we need the block we want, here is a list of blocks in the game as of 1/12/2023:

Nexus_Grass 

Wood

Grass 

Stone

Air (It doesn't do anything)

Leaf 

Dirt

1. So we will be using the spawnBlock() method!

spawnBlock("")

So pass in the block!

spawnBlock("Grass") [In my case, I wanted to spawn a block]

2. Then pass in our cords!

spawnBlock("Grass", 4, 2, 0) 

Now we are done! 

It should automatically load if it is saved as .groovy (or any other supported extensions) !
